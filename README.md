# AIS Data-Driven Maritime Monitoring Based on Transformer

## Paper Overview
This paper provides a comprehensive review of AIS data-driven maritime monitoring based on Transformer models, focusing on key techniques such as vessel trajectory prediction, vessel behavior detection, and vessel behavior prediction. With the increasing demands for safety, efficiency, and sustainability in global shipping, the application of AIS data plays a crucial role in enhancing maritime monitoring. The Transformer model, with its advantage in handling long sequence data and complex temporal dependencies, has proven to be an effective tool for processing AIS data.

## Research Focus
- **Vessel Trajectory Prediction**: Explores Transformer-based trajectory prediction methods, including generative and classification-based approaches.
- **Vessel Behavior Detection**: Evaluates Transformer-based methods for detecting vessel behaviors, focusing on anomaly detection and risk management.
- **Vessel Behavior Prediction**: Analyzes techniques for predicting future vessel states and navigational behaviors.

## Datasets
This study utilizes multiple publicly available AIS datasets, which have been filtered, cleaned, and analyzed statistically. The datasets cover various types of vessels and provide critical information about vessel locations, speeds, and headings.

- **Dataset Link**: [Baidu Cloud Link](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1hzsVVYXFzQipUl6dUQFD9A?pwd=2408)
- The dataset includes AIS messages from 19,185 vessels, totaling approximately 640 million records.
